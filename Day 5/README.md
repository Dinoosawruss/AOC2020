# Advent of Code Day 5

### Part 1
Find the largest seat ID on any boarding pass

#### My approach
I took the way of moving this much like a binary search, moving two pointers when certain conditions are met

### Part 2
Find the ID of your seat

#### My approach
I used the same code from part 1 but instead mapped each seat onto an array. I then found the empty seat in the array and returned the seat ID 

## Conclusion
I don't think this solution is the best but it does work very well and I'm very happy with it
